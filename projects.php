        <div class="caption">This house in San Rafael seemed to have cosmetic damage to the exterior sheathing, but when the first contractor began pulling things apart he found additional dry rot damage he could not handle. Me A Domus was called in to finish the job.</div>

        <div class="caption">Me A Domus designed and built this multi-level deck in Sebastopol. The challenge was to provide ample areas for dining tables and entertaining while creating a smooth transition to the lawn several feet below the level of the home’s floor.</div>

        <div class="caption">This was an insurance repair. This bath in Tiburon was badly water damaged. Our work was a delicate operation involving removing 3 ft by 4 ft marble slabs, fixing the leak, and putting them back without any damage to the marble. </div>

        <div class="caption">This was an insurance repair. This house in Sonoma was flooded. We repaired,  refurbished, and refinished the lower cabinets. The upper cabinets were not damaged and we refinished them to match the lowers.</div>

        <div class="caption">This house in San Rafael was virtually cut in half when a 100 foot eucalyptus tree fell on it. It required significant demolition and was more like a new construction job than a rehab or repair. We build everything from new additions to barns.</div>

        <div class="caption">This fence and gate protects a side yard and hot tub at a home in Sebastopol. The gate was custom built to fit the opening. The small “speakeasy” door at eye level enables those inside to see out while maintaining privacy.</div>

        <div class="caption">This is a custom hardwood floor made out of the oak slats used in winemaking. We milled all the slats ourselves and installed a nicely detailed custom floor. Quite a challenge, since the walls of this rustic Santa Rosa cottage were not straight or square!</div>
